VIM: Vim uses command mode and edit  (or insert) mode ( pressing i and esc to exit)

To save files you type in command mode :w or :w Namefile if it isn't named

:q to exit.

:wq! vim exits, saves and doesn't prompt before exiting. THE ORDER IS IMPORTANT!

We use the keys h (left) j (down) k (up) l (right) to move as arrow keys

In terms of words: w moves to the start of next word; e moves to the end of the word; and b moves to beginning of the word.

Moving within the text is not limited to individual keys; you can combine movement keys with a number. For example, 3w is the same as pressing w three times.


You can insert text multiple times.For example, an underline of a header might consist of 30 -s.

With 30i (then we type) - Esc, output is 30 times ---.

In text that is structured with parentheses or brackets, ( or { or [, use % to jump to the matching parenthesis or bracket.

To find and move to the next (or previous) occurrence of a character, use f and F, e.g. fo finds next o.

VIM SHORTCUTS (no : before letters)

g -> bottom of the file

gg -> top of the file

/ -> search example: /ubuntu it would search for the word ubuntu on the file, using the n letter it skips to the next finding.

esc + u -> undo changes

dd -> delete line

NANO SHORTCUTS:

ctrl +k -> cut a line
ctrl +u -> paste the line
