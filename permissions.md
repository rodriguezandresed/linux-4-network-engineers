Permissions on Linux:

filetypecode(3)(3)(3)

(owner)(group)(other)

r = read  (4)

w = write (2)

x = execute (1)

So for example, a value of 6 would mean read and write

`chmod` is used to change permissions

Remember we can pipe outputs to format text such as `command | grep` or `more or `less`

Remember that less allows you to scroll up the output and more only lets you keep scrolling down
